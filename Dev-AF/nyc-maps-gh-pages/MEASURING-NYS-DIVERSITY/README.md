# Beyond Classroom Diversity
## How Community Context Influences Student Achievement in New York State
---
Thanks for checking out the first visualization of a series being developed for _"How Community Context Influences Student Achievement in New York State,"_ a paper by Emma Jane Medina, Joshua Smith, and Kevin Nguyen exploring the impact of diversity on educational outcomes for NYU Wagner's Capstone in Applied Research.  The diversity map can be viewed [here](http://kvn219.github.io/NYU-ADV-GIS/Diversity-Map/) and a preview of the paper can be view [here](https://github.com/kvn219/NYU-ADV-GIS/blob/gh-pages/Diversity-Map/Draft.md).

At this time, we want to thank [Chris Wong]( https://twitter.com/chris_whong) for teaching an amazing class and helping Wagnerds use their passion for public service for data driven driven mapping.  Also, thanks to Mike Bostock for creating D3 and making amazing tutorials.

# TODO
