            <p align="left">
                Over the past 30 years, an interesting phenomenon has taken shape in education systems in the United States: despite rising levels of national diversity, public schools have become increasingly racially segregated. Relational diversity is the discrepancy
                of diversity experienced in oneâ€™s surroundings versus the classroom. To explore the impact of relational diversity education on the New York State English Language Art (ELA) proficiency rates, we used relational diversity as an index (RDI)
                and compared it to poverty, limited English proficiency, and students with disabilities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index">Blau Index </a>was used with population estimates from the American Community
                Survey (2008-13) census tracts to calculate a community's diversity. For school diversity, we use data from the New York State Department of Education <a href="https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php">(NYSED 2013-2014).</a> You can review
